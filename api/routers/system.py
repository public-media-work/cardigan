"""System management endpoints.

Provides status and a single "Restart Components" action:
- GET  /status              — liveness of api / worker / watcher
- POST /restart             — request a restart of all running components
- POST /watcher/heartbeat   — watcher liveness ping (+ restart flag back)

Restart uses "Option B": a single ``restart_requested_at`` timestamp in the
config KV table; each component compares it to its own process start time and
self-exits, and Docker's ``restart: unless-stopped`` policy brings it back. No
Docker socket. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-system-components-restart-design.md.
